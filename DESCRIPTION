Description: The routine twosample_test() in this package runs the
    two sample test using various test statistic. The p values are
    found via permutation or large sample theory. The routine twosample_power() allows the
    calculation of the power in various cases, and plot_power() draws the corresponding power graphs.
    The routine run.studies allows a user to quickly study the power of a new method and 
    how it compares to some of the standard ones.
